<h3>Twitch Draws</h3>

Drawing canvas to be controlled similar to Twitch plays Pokemon, moving the paintbrush with commands such as "right", "down", etc. and changing the brush color with "red", "green", etc.
Originally done for a class project and deployed over Azure connecting to SQL database for multi user interaction, but changed back to local version for public access (and so I don't get charged on my Azure account)
